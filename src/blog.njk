          <p class="article-body">
            <strong>Life can get complicated really quickly</strong>, but it
            doesn't have to be! There are many ways to simplify your life,
            <a href="#">a few of which we've explored in the past</a>. This week
            we're taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can find
            simplicity in the life you already living.

          <p class="article-body">
            A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either
            don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact
            they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where
            you want it to and make things pop like never before.
