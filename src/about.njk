        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Hi, I'm Liz McCready. I live in Toronto, Canada. I'm a dual Canadian/ New Zealand citizen and lived in Wellinton, New Zealand in elementary school. As a software engineer, I enjoy building beautiful, accessible apps that solve real world problems. As a writer I enjoy distilling complex technical topics into simple, enjoyable to read articles. I'm very passionate about accessibility / A11y and have been an assistive technology specialist, special educator, and a "seeing guide daughter" for my mom since I was four.</p>

<p>Aside from my professional life, I've been knitting since I was six, have three rescue cats, and enjoy volunteering (it's a bit of an addiction - I have over 15,000 volunteer hours!). In early 2022, I started doing Duolingo French everyday - now I'm also doing Dutch, Welsh, German, and Norwegian.</p>
