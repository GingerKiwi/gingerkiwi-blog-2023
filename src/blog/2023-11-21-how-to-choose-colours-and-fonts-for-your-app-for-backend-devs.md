The app is named byte. there are multiple colourful small shapes swirling around the background. The second phone in the lower left shows the same app after login. It's also a black background. The top has a search bar that says \"user name\" Then there is an orange-yellow area that says \"Spotlight\" with stars around it. Underneath is a light blue area that says \"Popular Now\", then another area that's purple that says \"Experimental, New & Trending\" finally there's two side by side squares with no text.

Every time I get in a discussion with backend or sometimes full-stack devs that prefer the backend, they say that one reason they prefer backend is that they're "not good at design". However, with a few simple tools and tips even those scared of design can become more comfortable in designing good looking apps.

Every time I get in a discussion with backend or sometimes full-stack devs that prefer the backend, they say that one reason they prefer backend is that they're "not good at design". But just like anyone can learn the basics of coding, anyone can learn the basics of design. With a few simple tools and tips, even those scared of design can become more comfortable in designing good looking apps. 

This is second first in a series of articles on tips and tricks for web and app design - both for backend dev, and new developers. Note that because this series is aimed at devs who are uncomfortable with design, a few of the methods, tools, and tips are ones that I wouldn't necessarily recommend to frontend developers or those with experience in other types of art and design  or non-Figma tools like Adobe Xd/Adobe CC or Sketch.

<strong>Today we're looking at how to choose a beautiful and accessible colour pallet and fonts (typography) for your app.</strong> We'll be using [Tailwind CSS colors page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors). You don't have to be using Tailwind in your project, but the colours page helps keep things simple. <strong>This process should take about 15-30 minutes.</strong> However, it could be as long as an hour if you spend more time trying different options out.

## Contents

1. Choose a dark or light theme
2. Choose your favourite colour from the Tailwind colour page
3. Use the Sessions College colour calculator to instantly calculate a three colour pallet using your favourite colour
4. Convert the three colours to Tailwind colours
5. Use Realtime Colours to visualize examples of your colour scheme
6. Choose a header and a body font from Google Fonts
7. Add your two fonts to Realtime Colours
8. Double check the contrast using Colors contrast checker

## Tools Used

There's so many tools on the web that can help you design a colour pallet and typography for websites and mobile apps. I've chosen the following set because it's worked for myself, and for when I helped my Toronto Javascript coding buddy with his new Astro site. Using the Tailwind CSS Colours has two added bonuses of keeping things organized (the colours are in a grid), and being simple to use if you happen to be using Tailwind.

### Setup and Organize Your Tools

- Open the following websites and tools. 
- Arrange them in tabs from left to right in your browser of choice. 
- You will also need a place to take notes. A markdown file is ideal for this, but you could even use a Word or Google doc.
