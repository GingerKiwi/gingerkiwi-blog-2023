 This is a daily record of my second iteration of 100 Days of Code. This time I'm doing 5 days a week instead of 7. I love the structure of 100 Days of Code, but having a break to do other things keeps coding fresh. This iteration I'm starting by focusing on UI Design and Engineering - including the nitty gritty of Figma, the fundamentals of design, and more advanced CSS including animations. As always I'm thinking about how what I'm learning impacts and interacts with accessibility.

# 100 Days of Code

This is a daily record of my second iteration of 100 Days of Code. I'll also be posting on LinkedIn, and doing occasional articles.

This time I'm doing 5 days a week instead of 7. I love the structure of 100 Days of Code, but having a break to do other things keeps coding fresh. This iteration I'm starting by focusing on UI Design and Engineering - including the nitty gritty of Figma, the fundamentals of design, and more advanced CSS including animations. As always I'm thinking about how what I'm learning impacts and interacts with accessibility.

| 101 | 2023-02-12 | Sunday    | UI Design           | Full Project Refactoring up to "Initial Media Queries"                                                                                     | I will want to repeat this project in VSCode to really get a handle on the nav, flexbox, and grid.    Maybe best way for flexbox and grid is to do articles w/ code blocks?         |
| 102 | 2023-02-13 | Monday    | UI Design           | Finish Full Project Refactoring: https://scrimba.com/playlist/pYLZZS6                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 103 | 2023-02-14 | Tuesday   | UI Design inc Figma | Start TeaPlace Design Project. Create initial Figma mockup (mobile), start CSS code. Create initial Figma mockup (mobile), start CSS code. | There's a lot of decisions to make with design! The "brand colours" provided don't have the best contrast. Got around this by using opacity (#fff with 20% opacity for the main bg. |
| 104 | 2023-02-15 | Wednesday | UI Design           | Implement mobile design in CSS. Review solution video for getting mobile nav working.                                                      | Next step is to go back over, code along, and make sure I understand why this solution works vs solution in previous section works for mobile nav                                   |
| 105 | 2023-02-17 | Friday  |  UI Design - Drop Shadows   | Drop Shadows section https://scrimba.com/playlist/pG63yU5    |  Tired today, so took a break from larger project to learn something smaller.   Best/easiest to use rbga instead of hex. Used https://rgbacolorpicker.com/ to pick colours. Also https://shadows.brumm.af/ for layered shadows.                                                      |

2023-02-16 | Thursday | Writing Day. Tired, tea was still brewing, and typed "git commit -a" instead of "git add ." ended up needing to research how to stop a git process. Used "rm -f .git/index.lock" from https://www.javaprogramto.com/2021/11/another-git-process-seems-to-be-running-in-this-repository.html
