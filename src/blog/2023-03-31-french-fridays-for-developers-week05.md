To celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo French at the beginning of March, 2023 I've started French for Devs Fridays. Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. (Today is day 430 of French and day 90 of Dutch!)

Week 05 - March 30, 2023:

>Mon chat a renversé mon café sur mon clavier!


English:  
My cat spilled my coffee on my keyboard!

It's a special cat week in my home. **It's Kitten's 16th birthday tomorrow!**

 He's never spilled coffee on my keyboard. Fifteen years ago he arrived for "just two weeks" as an emergency foster from a kill shelter. Huge foster fail! Kitten made me a crazy cat lady. Over the years we've had seven rescue cats including Kitten. Now there's Kitten (16 tomorrow!), Boo (10 years old), and Maybel (almost 6 years old).
