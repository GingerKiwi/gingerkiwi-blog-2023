 This is a daily record of my second iteration of 100 Days of Code. This time I'm doing 5 days a week instead of 7. This is week 05 of 20 weeks. This week I'll be finishing UI Design and CSS.

#### Day 120  |  2023-03-13  |   Monday  | Focus: UI Design  |  

Main Resource: Scrimba UI Design Course https://scrimba.com/learn/designbootcamp

Completed: 
1) Finished UI Animations  
2) Started final UI Design Course project - to "Defining the Hero Section CSS part 2"

Refection: The animations module wasn't anything new. It was just a colour transform on a single button. I'll need to delve into this deeper at some point.
I love design and css, but I'm getting bored; it's time to delve into Javascript again!
I really want to apply all this and upskill my Javascript for yarnhelp.app

UI Design Course Certificate

Refections and Notes for UI Design: Can do css descendent selectors 3 deep not just two deep like this:
```css
/* to target a image(s) inside of an li inside of a list */
ul.features li img {
	width: 40px;
}
```

To make an svg into a watermark:
```css
.fern {
	position: absolute;
	bottom: 0;
	left: 0;
	z-index: 1;
	width: 80%;
	opacity: .1;
}
```

To have three items in a media query (eg small tablet) align with two on top and one centred below:
<img src="/assets/blog/Screen Shot 2023-03-14 at 11.38.39 AM.png" alt="screenshot of a section of a web page showing two items on top with one on the bottom. Each item has a medium green icon with a small paragraph of lorem ipsum placeholder text below in white sans-serif font. all items are centred." class="img-smaller">
	 
```css
.featured-cabins, 
.features, 
.testimonials /* testimonials fits well three items across so there's no need to apply the li:last-child rules below */
				{
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(120px, 100%), 1fr));
	grid-gap: 1rem;
	justify-content: space-evenly;
}

/* Just using .features:last-child doesn't work because we're looking for the last li not the last .features */
.featured-cabins li:last-child,
.features li:last-child
{
	grid-column: 1 / span 2;
	max-width: 50%;
	justify-self: center;
}
/* Note: .testimonials fits well three items across so there's no need to apply the li:last-child rules above */
```
- At some point I should review/get more into GSAP GreenSock Animation Platform: https://greensock.com/get-started/

Reflections and Notes for Command Line Course:
- OhMy zsh is a lifesaver!
	- This along with sudo was how I could open the .zshrc file and get around the "permission denied" issue in MacOS.
- Apparently I have Python 3.8.3 installed. (Current release is 3.11.1)
- #UI-design-ideas the https://ohmyz.sh/ site has a nice colour animation on the themes icon. :-)

#### Day 122  |  2023-03-15  |   Wednesday  | Focus: Flexbox  |  

Main Resources:
1) [WesBos What the Flexbox Course](https://flexbox.io/)

Completed: 
1) What the Flexbox to video 11 of 20: *"Finally understanding Flexbox flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis" **

Refection: Tired today, but this I can do.
Need to fix the github issues with my repo.
