 This is a daily record of my second iteration of 100 Days of Code. This time I'm doing 5 days a week instead of 7. This is week 06 of 20 weeks. I started early on Sunday with more work on https://yarnhelp.app. Monday I worked though the AxeCon Structuring Accessible Forms webinar and started an article "2023-03-20-accessible-forms-and-the-yarnhelp.app-project". I took Tuesday and Wednesday off coding to write two long form articles, but did take a look through, forked, and opened on my vscode another dev's react and typescript project. Thursday, I'm back finishing Wes Bos' Command Line course. I had to go back a bit because I accidently erased the content in my .zshrc file shutting down my machiene late on Tuesday.

1) Fixed my accidentally erased .zshcr file (see code below)

This Stack Overflow was helpful in fixing my accidentally erased (but not deleted) .zshrc file

```
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
```
Notes for new devs or devs new to command line: 
1) Before running the command I had to navigate to my .oh-my-zsh folder using the command line. 
2) Dot folders ( .my-folder-name ) are not available via MacOS finder. Regular folders ( my-folder-name ) are.
3) I usually name my folders either with a Capital letter, or in ALLCAPS to help me see Folders, vs MAIN-FOLDERS, vs files.xx .
