To celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo French at the beginning of March, 2023 I've started French for Devs Fridays. Here you'll find weekly useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. 
Today is my 479th day of French, 139th day of Dutch, and 14th Day of ASL (American Sign Language)!

Week 05 - March 30, 2023:

>"Mesurer les progrès de la programmation par lignes de code, c'est comme mesurer les progrès de la construction d'un avion en poids."
>~ Bill Gates

English:  

“Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.”

– Bill Gates
