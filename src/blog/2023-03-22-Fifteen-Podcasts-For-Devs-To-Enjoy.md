 Andrew Clarkson, cohost of Loonie Engineering, admitted this week that he doesn't listen to podcasts and asked for some recommendations. I'm an avid podcast listener and have had this article on the back burner for ages. So Andrew's LinkedIn post is the carrot to get this article out. Here's 15 podcasts for devs to enjoy. Five are tech related, five are ones I enjoy when I want to feed my brain but give it a break too, and five are about other cities and countries.

Andrew Clarkson cohost of Loonie Engineering* admitted this week that he doesn't listen to podcasts and asked for some recommendations. I'm an avid podcast listener and have had this article on the back burner for ages. So Andrew's LinkedIn post is the carrot to get this article out. 

Here's 15 podcasts for devs to enjoy. These are ones that I personally listen to. Five are tech related, five are ones I enjoy when I want to feed my brain but give it a break too, and five are about other cities and countries. 

Each list is in no particular order, but they are my top five favourite podcasts in each category. 

## Five Tech Podcasts

### 1) JS Party 
__*"A weekly celebration of JavaScript and the¬†web"*.__ JS Party is fun and along the way you get to learn things, hear other devs stories, and what's new and awesome with Javascript and the web.

Hosts: 
- A huge cast of reoccurring awesome characters.

### 2) Scrimba
__*"A weekly pod(cast) about learning to code and how to get your first junior developer job. Best enjoyed with [The Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend)."*__ This is a great one for new devs and those starting out on the adventure that is web development. Shows alternate between interviews with new devs, and senior devs and industry leaders.

One of the episodes features a dev here in Toronto. Hussien Khayoon, Staff Developer at Shopify [Episode 84: Bootcamp Mentor Hussien Khayoon: Careers Come in Three Phases, and Here‚Äôs How To Navigate Them](https://scrimba.com/podcast/bootcamp-mentor-hussien-khayoon-careers-come-in-three-phases-and-heres-how-to-navigate-them)

Host: 
- [Alex Booker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bookercodes/?originalSubdomain=uk)

### 4) Loonie Engineering

### 5) Design Life
__*Listen to two women in tech talk about how they balance side projects on top of a full time job. Design Life is a podcast about design and side projects for motivated creators. It was born after your hosts, two serial side project addicts, saw a gap in the podcast market for a conversational show about design and the issues young creatives face, that was hosted by two women.*__

I highly recommend Design Life for devs that want a better understanding of the design process. Both hosts are fellow expat Kiwis (from Aotearoa New Zealand). I ran into Femke on YouTube in 2021 when I was still figuring out my career direction. When I reached out to her she awesomely offered that we have a Google Meet. Only to find out that **Femke and I caught the school bus in Whitby, New Zealand on the opposite sides of the same street.** It's a really small world!

**Hosts:**
- **[Femke van Schoonhoven](www.femke.design).** Design Lead at Gusto. Formerly of Wealth Simple and Uber. Femke teaches product design on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/femkesvs) 
- **[Charli Prangley](https://charlimarie.com/)** Creative Director at ConvertKit and [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/user/charlimarieTV),

### Bonus: Allied 
__*"A podcast on the people innovating and implementing access across industries."*__
I included Allied as a bonus in the tech category as it's only partly digital accessibility. It's an awesome podcast for both A11y and accessibility in general. Allied tells stories, so it's an enjoyable one for listening to on walks.

- **Host: [Elisa Lewis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eedelberg)**. Senior Inbound Marketing Manager at 3Play Media. She creates and produces educational content on all things video and web accessibility,

## Five Entertaining and Engaging Podcasts

### 1) Stuff the British Stole by Marc Fennell
__*"Throughout its reign, the British Empire stole a lot of stuff. Today those objects are housed in genteel institutions across the UK and the world. They usually come with polite plaques. This is a series about the not-so-polite history behind those objects.*__

*"Each episode, award-winning journalist, author and genetic-potluck, Marc Fennell, picks one artefact and takes you on the wild, evocative, sometimes funny, often tragic adventure of how it got to where it is today.*

*These objects will ultimately help us see the Commonwealth ‚Äî and ourselves ‚Äî today, in a different light."*

- **Host: Marc Fennell** Journalist with  the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC, but not the other ABC in the USA).

### 2) Lateral with Tom Scott 
__*"A podcast about interesting quiz¬†questions, and even¬†more interesting¬†answers, hosted¬†by¬†Tom¬†Scott."*__

- [Host: Tom Scott](https://www.tomscott.com/) is an English "original generation" YouTuber from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. As well as his Lateral podcast check out his March 2023 YouTube series on Aotearoa New Zealand (especially [this one in Wellington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcp1BfPUeOc), his years of *"Things You May Not Know"*  and his *Tom Scott Plus* channel.

### 3) We Regret to Inform You: The Rejection Podcast

__*"The fascinating stories of successful people who triumphed over debilitating career rejection. And the insights those rejections provide."*__

If you're in a rut, frustrated with a job hunt, or having a serious dose of imposter syndrome have a listen to *"We Regret to Inform You"*.  Stories include Lucille Ball, Cindy Lauper, Mad Men, AirBnB, Breaking Bad, Women in the Boston Marathon, Netflix, and Back to the Future.

Try starting with 
- [Episode 57: Rejecting Mad Men - Part 1 of 2](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rejecting-mad-men/id1503835352?i=1000581611489)

### 4) 99% Invisible 
__*"99% Invisible is a sound-rich, narrative podcast hosted by Roman Mars about all the thought that goes into the things we don‚Äôt think about ‚Äîthe unnoticed architecture and design that shape our world. With approximately 500 million downloads, 99pi is one of the most popular podcasts."*__

With 581 episodes as of March 21, 2023 it could be hard to decide where. to start. So, in keeping with the Kiwi theme of GingerKiwi.blog try listening to my favourite [Episode 514: Track Set Two](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/train-set-track-two) about funiculars railways that starts with the Wellington, NZ cable car the the 100s of privately owned funiculars in the city. (My Kiwi home town is built on the side of mountains).

### 5) You're Dead to Me 
*""The comedy podcast that takes history seriously. Greg Jenner brings together the best names in comedy and history to learn and laugh about the past.""*
[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07mdbhg](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07mdbhg)

### Bonus: Nut Jobs by Marc Fennell

__*"It's the $10 million heist you've never heard of. In a matter of months, dozens of truckloads disappeared from American highways. But what were they carrying? Nuts. Marc Fennell takes you into a rabbit-hole of crime syndicates, stolen identities and private investigators that will change the way you think about food forever. 80% of the world's almonds are grown in the heart of California but this journey will take you to Italy; the Spanish coast; deep under the earth; and even into space."*__

- Winner of the Best Podcast Trophy at the 2020 Mumbrella Publish Awards
- Bronze winner of the Best True Crime Podcast at the 2020 Australian Podcast Awards
- 
I'm a huge fan of Marc Fennell's work. I've listened to this series on Audible twice and it's such a plot twisty often humorous puzzle of investigative journalism. *Nut Jobs* is only available on Audible so it didn't make the main list.

## Five Podcasts About Cities and Other Countries

With remote work and flexible hours devs have the option to travel and/or live in so many different areas around the globe. Here are five podcasts I enjoy about cities and other countries. One of my other passions besides tech, knitting, good stories, and history is urban geography and travel. As a dual Kiwi (Aotearoa New Zealand)/Canadian citizen I've ended up with two from NZ on my top five list.
