 To celebrate getting to 400 days on Duolingo French this week I'm starting French for Devs Fridays. Here you'll find  useful and/or amusing French phrases for developers. This first week is a translated quote from Harry Porter-Mills, Head of Technology & Infrastructure at Relay Platform, on Toronto JS Slack. L’interface utilisateur est née de l’esprit d’un développeur Java travaillant sur une machine Windows au début des années 2000. Read the full post for the translation.
