ðŸ¦“ May was Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder Awareness Month! ðŸ¦“

To wrap things up I'm writing this more personal, but still career related post. Writing this feels a lot like submitting my first pull request as a new dev on a large public GitHub repo - like I'm jumping off a cliff on a zipline with tons of people watching. 

Until the last few weeks, I haven't posted anything about being a disabled developer. It's taking a huge risk because I'm a new dev, and job hunting is hard enough right now without having to face all the conscious and unconscious social biases and stigmas of being disabled. 

However, it's tiring trying to hide a huge part of who I am, and I'd love to share tips and tricks on how I make my developer workspace, VS Code, and home accessible. While many of them are essential for me, they're also great for other devs too. (And apparently for my cat Boo who's figured out how to get the bedroom Homepod mini to play music for him.)

Also, enough people in the dev community in Toronto know me in person and have seen me use various mobility aids, and that I'm going through the very long process of getting a wheelchair. It's an "active user manual wheelchair" with a power assist. ... Being a dev of course I'm going with the power assist that has an app!

So yes, I have:
- hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (hEDS), 
- several types of dysautonomia (standing sucks), and 
- mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). 

Having hEDS means that I almost always "look fine".  Sometimes I can be really active, sometimes I need knee and/or ankle braces, and I rotate between using canes, Nordic walking poles, and crutches. Other days when everything hurts, I just stay at home and code on the couch with the cats.  Coding is a form of meditation. 

Dysautonomia means I can't ride in cars, and busy transit can be scary. After a particularly horrid bus ride last spring I stopped the Bloor subway train and left Spadina station with Pete the Paramedic. I love in person events, but until I have my wheelchair I have to really plan. Because I have to be super hydrated knowing where the accessible bathrooms are is so important.

MCAS means that at events like TorontoJS BBQs and socials I bring my own food or just have a diet Pepsi. (Pepsi and coke are vasoconstrictors - so they help keep my blood pressure up) . It can make career social events awkward, so it's awesome when people don't make a big deal about it.

Right now, I'm off work at my part-time job for a week because half the staff didn't show up on Monday and I had to stand for hours to help my one other team member that did show up to work.  Several joints have partially dislocated (subluxed), my hearing is wonky, and my vision is blurry (and the list goes on). 

However, it means I have an entire week to devote to coding on the couch with the cats, and being more involved in all the cool dev community things. I started a deep dive into React yesterday and am now working with GitHub Copilot - so I'm learning to code  by talking!

Thanks to everyone at TorontoJS, more recently Women Who Code, and the wonderful dev community to being awesome and supportive and fun! I hope the articles and posts I share are giving something back.

I think I'm going to leave this here for now. It's a beginning of sorts.

PS ... Remember, accessibility isn't just about users who use screen readers. It's also about your fellow devs- and apparently our really Smart cats who can get Siri to play them music on our Smart Home systems.
