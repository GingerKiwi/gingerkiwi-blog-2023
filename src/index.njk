        <strong> Welcome to the Ginger Kiwi Blog!</strong> This site is developed with 11ty/Eleventy, Nunjucks, markdown, Obsdian, and css with css variables for colours and fonts - and of course lots of "help" from Boo (my grey cat), as well as Maybel and Kitten. Scroll down to see some of my recent and featured articles, or go the the <a href="https://gingerkiwi.blog/blog/">blog page</a> to see all my  articles.</p>
      <h3>Updates for Fall 2023</h3>
      <p><strong>Nov 13, 2023: Visit <a href="https://gingerkiwi-2024-02.fly.dev rel="noreferrer" rel=”noopener” target=”_blank">https://gingerkiwi-2024-02.fly.dev</a> to see the new combined, fullstack, Ginger Kiwi blog and dev portfolio being built in public on Fly.io using Astro, Docker, and SQLite3!</strong> <br>A static version is also deployed on <a href="https://gingerkiwi.xyz rel="noreferrer" rel=”noopener” target=”_blank">https://gingerkiwi.xyz</a>. <br>My ".xyz" domain is a temporary one I have for testing.</p> 
      <p>It's past time for a redesign of the Ginger Kiwi blog. Having dedicated pages for topics such as French for Devs, design tips for backend devs, DSA, etc, would make the site more user friendly. I also need to set up an RSS, implement some A11y enhancements, fix the styling of article main images, and update the theme to at least a dark mode, and ideally a dark/light toggle. Also, 11ty 2.0 came out months ago, and Astro has been taking off. So I've been on the fence if I'm going to migrate to 11ty 2.0, or try something new with Astro. </p>
      <p>This morning (Tuesday, Nov 07), I saw that Lazar Nikolov has <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-full-stack-blog-with-astro-7ffcf9ec" rel="noreferrer" rel=”noopener” target=”_blank”>a new Astro blog course</a> that's free on Egghead.io for the next two weeks. So here we go! I've started working on a new site that consolodates this blog with my .dev portfolio site.</p>
