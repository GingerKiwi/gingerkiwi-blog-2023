          healthy, you have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that
          is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

        <p class="article-body">
          Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it
          ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By
          keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance
          everything out.

        <p class="article-body">
          A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either
          don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact
          they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you
          want it to and make things pop like never before.
