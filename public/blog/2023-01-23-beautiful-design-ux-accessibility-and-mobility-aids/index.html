        <p class="article-info">Jan 22, 2023</p>
        <p>This past weekend I volunteered at #A11yTOCamp at Microsoft here in Toronto. One of the best parts was meeting new awesome people and seeing ones I've met at events in the past again. With the event's focus on accessibility there were many people with visible mobility aids including walking canes, wheelchairs, rollators (walkers), white canes, and service dogs.</p>
<p>This led to many conversations about design and mobility aids. A couple of the guide dogs, such as Louise's GD Charlie, had the new CNIB harness with a guiding handle that detaches for when the dogs are laying down (like during a talk), then clips back on for guiding. Instead of the more common upside down u-shaped guide handle that attaches on either side of the guide harness, the new CNIB ones are a single pole that clips into the centre of the dogs harness on their back. What a revolutionary design! It's a solid example of good design. But what separates good design and UX from great design?</p>
<p><strong>Great design and user experience isn't just about a product being functional and usable, it should be aesthetically pleasing and bring joy to users</strong>. It should make people want to use the product because it's fun, is enjoyable, makes them smile, and makes their day better - not only because it works well. So how does this apply to mobility aids?</p>
<h3>What Are Mobility Aids?</h3>
<p>First, let's start with what a mobility aid is. <strong>A mobility aid is anything that helps someone with a disability, chronic illness, or injury be mobile.</strong> There are hundreds of types of mobility aids. The most commonly thought of ones are canes, crutches, wheelchairs, and scooters, but there's so many more. If you've used a bandaid to pad a bad blister to help you walk, you've used a mobility aid. Guide dogs (seeing eye dogs) and mobility service dogs and their harnesses are mobility aids - really cute and high maintenance mobility aids. People who use mobility aids don't always need the same mobility aid(s) every day or even use them the same way. Disability, chronic illness, and injury are dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Too often mobility aids are medicalized and/or are promoted as only for elderly people such as in the screenshot of the <a href="https://shop.wellwise.ca/pages/canes?">Shopper's Drugmart Wellwise landing page for canes shown below.</a></strong> The latter reinforces the stereotype that disability only affects older people. The former is boring, joyless, and can be soul crushing. For braces and bandages, the beige &quot;skin colour&quot; of many of them isn't anyone's skin colour, and it gets dirty and even uglier with use. While boring canes and crutches may be well designed for function, they're not great designs. They don't inspire people to use them, especially fashionable and younger users.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/screenshot-canes-shoppersdrugmart-wellwise-website.png" alt="Screenshot of the &quot;hero&quot; section for Shoppers Drugmart Wellwise landing page for canes" title="image on right side shows a senior woman and man walking outside on a trail with trees in the background. The man is using a plain brown walking cane. The couple are smiling. They appear Asian. Left side is a medium blue area with white text. The text says: Canes. Stand Firm. Canes are a popular solution when you need extra mobility support to remain active in your daily life. While a cane might seem like a simple product, the number of models, adjustments, and accessories can seem overwhelming in the beginning. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here to help you find the right fit for your needs. There's a button to 'shop canes' and one labled cane resources "></p>
<h3>Great Design Can Support Mental Health &amp; Happiness</h3>
<p>I spoke to a UX professional at the after party who's sibling has a chronic illness that causes pain and fatigue. She's avoided using mobility aids that would make her life easier because they're ugly, and she's very into fashion. They're also very medical in design. Like many with chronic illness she also has medical ptsd*. This isn't vanity. It's prioritizing mental health over physical.  The only mobility aids she's seen are the boring, ugly, medical ones that don't reflex who she is. That's part of the inspiration for this article - having one place to share some of the great designed, beautiful and/or cool mobility aids with others.</p>
<p>I've had similar experiences being an active outdoors person and former dancer who's sprained my ankles way too many times.  There's been times, such as last summer/fall when I sprained one twice and the other once, when it would have been better for my ankles to use the ugly, clunky &quot;air cast&quot; walking ankle brace and grey ugly underarm crutches, but I opted to use my Nordic walking poles (or my purple and pink canes on transit) and pink zebra print KT Tape instead, because doing so made me happier. (And resulted in less people asking <em>&quot;What's wrong with you?&quot;</em> and more comments like <em>&quot;Those are really cool canes!&quot;</em>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neo-Walk founder Lindsay Watterson:
I‚Äôve spoken to many people who use fashion and style as a creative tool to cope with chronic pain and illness. I know I do. I always feel much more ‚Äô human‚Äô when I‚Äôve made the effort, even when it‚Äôs a struggle.¬†<br>
Today our gorgeous¬†<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bumpandhustle/">@bumpandhustle</a>¬†speaks about her day.¬†<br>
ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞<br>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bumpandhustle/">@bumpandhustle</a>¬†Today, instead of hiding my pain and not posting, I went from pjs to yellow heels, a white tulle skirt, a tie-dye top and did my hair and make up just so I could.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
Because in that moment, that‚Äôs what my chronic pain needed as a creative outlet. ‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
I‚Äôve written about this before- recently even. That sometimes I lean into my pain or my anxiety by dressing her up.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
Letting my body feel with flourish.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
It doesn‚Äôt work all the time and that‚Äôs ok. ‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
But sometimes when I feel that particular tremulous voltage, whether it‚Äôs a flare or swirling anxious thoughts -or today my connective tissue disease causing severe joint pain - I know it‚Äôs time to plug in and show up this way.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
And my whole family shows up with me. ‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
That‚Äôs all for today.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
I just wanted to show you what showing up looked like.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
I wanted to show you how we got my mind off my pain, while celebrating my body for a good 30 mins.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
Thank you Heath for taking this pic. For being there with me.‚Å£<br>
I love you so much.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
There were a few times today I didn‚Äôt know how to get through but we did it, as always, one breath at a time.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
If you are navigating through a hard day please know that I see you. ‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
You are not alone.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>
I am so glad you are here, showing up however you feel is right for you.‚Å£<br>
‚Å£<br>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>Some things to think about as you read:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why can't mobility aids be fashionable as well as functional?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Why don't web designers and developers make more of an effort to use images with people of a variety of ages and ethnicities using mobility aids that look awesome?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Well there are fashionable, cool, and functionally well designed mobility aids. Here's a few. A few are from my own experience and/or wish list. Others are from my hours of watching YouTube while I knit, or conversations with people about their mobility aids. Not surprisingly many of the best designed mobility aids have been designed by people who actually use mobility aids. This is not a comprehensive list of types of mobility aids nor brands, but an overview of examples of great design - aids that are beautiful, cool, <em>and</em> functional.</p>
<h2>Walking Sticks/Canes</h2>
<h3>Neo Walk www.neo-walk.com</h3>
<p>Some of, if not the most fashionable walking sticks out there are from Neo Walk in the UK. Neo Walk walking sticks are made of beautiful tactile acrylic, come in so many colours including clear translucent and glitter, a choice of handle shapes, and can even light up. Lindsay Watterson https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndsay-watterson-a146b97a/?originalSubdomain=uk created neo-walk in 2013 after becoming and amputee in 2010.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I was so disappointed with the lack of choice, style, and inclusion in the fashion and disability aids world. I felt old, I felt left out and devastated that nobody expected anything better for me. So, I made myself a walking stick. People started asking me where I got this stick and so Neo Walk was born.&quot;

<p>Three cool Neo Walk options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gatsby - clear with gold glitter: https://www.neo-walk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Neo-Gatsby-7-scaled.jpg</li>
<li>Bubblegum Blush pink translucent with bubbles: https://www.neo-walk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6067-scaled.jpg</li>
<li>Beetlejuice themed walking stick with t-handle: https://www.neo-walk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Beetlejuice-1-Close-Up-1-scaled.jpg</li>
</ul>
<h3>Switch Sticks</h3>
<p>A more affordable option for those of us in Canada (or the USA) is a folding walking stick by Switch Sticks. They are sturdy metal folding canes with a variety of colours and patterns. There's only one handle style - derby. I have two of these, both purchased on Amazon. My newest one is the &quot;Viking&quot; purple after I sprained my ankle again in summer 2022.</p>
