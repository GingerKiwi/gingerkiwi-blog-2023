</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            The Alice in Wonderland Project started without much planning during Hacktoberfest 2022. Learning GitHub workflows and how to work as part of team building a project can be intimidating and challenging for new developers. So I created an open source repo to help other new developers learn GitHub work flows, learn how to contribute to a remote team project, get involved with open source while being social and making something fun. However, I&#39;ve since realized that I was actually creating something more than an open source project. It&#39;s the fledgling curriculum of a project based learning program.

</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            Andrew Clarkson, cohost of Loonie Engineering with Chris Naismith, admitted this week that he doesn&#39;t listen to podcasts and asked for some recommendations. I&#39;m an avid podcast listener and have had this article on the back burner for ages. So Andrew&#39;s LinkedIn post is the carrot to get this article out. Here&#39;s 15 podcasts for devs to enjoy. Five are tech related, five podcasts with engaging stories and interesting facts for curious dev minds, and five are about other cities and countries - including of course Aotearoa New Zealand.

            I had a couple of quite negative experiences last night. One I have to continue to deal with sometime today. However, I want to start the day on a positive note with sharing a story about the amazing person who was my first retail manager, Namroo. As I was only 13 years old, I was expecting to just be sweeping and mopping floors and cleaning up at the corner shop. Instead, this amazing man with over 40 years of retail management experience treated me like an apprentice. I got trained on every single last part of grocery retail. He&#39;s had a life-long impact on me.

I also dived back into Javascript on Thursday reviewing constructor functions, methods and Object.assign(). On Friday I updated the design and deployed my Yarn Help! project to my own domain at https://yarnhelp.app. Finally on Saturday I worked extensively on the Docs, including plans for future expansion.

            International Wheelchair Day is an annual global event that started in 2008 to celebrate the positive impacts that wheelchairs have had on wheelchair users&#39; lives. For fellow developers, and engineers this may not be a coding article, but it&#39;s still relevant for us. Disabled people are our coworkers and peers as well as users of our apps, websites, and software. Also, wheelchairs are a huge awesome technical feat of engineering and design. Did you know that electric wheelchairs and power assist add ons for active user manual wheelchairs often have connected software and apps? Plus, I included a free dev resource at the end of the article!

</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            On January 21, 2023 I volunteered at #A11yTOCamp at Microsoft here in Toronto. With the event&#39;s focus on accessibility there were many people with visible mobility aids. This led to many conversations about design and mobility aids. Great design and user experience isn&#39;t just about a product being functional and usable, it should be aesthetically pleasing and bring joy to users. This is true for both digital and physical products. The main inspiration for this article is to have one place to share some of the great designed, beautiful and/or cool mobility aids with others, and to discuss this through the lens of design.

This iteration I&#39;m starting by focusing on UI Design and Engineering - including the nitty gritty of Figma, the fundamentals of design, and more advanced CSS including animations. As always I&#39;m thinking about how what I&#39;m learning impacts and interacts with accessibility.

            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            This past November 2022, I did a major refresh of my LinkedIn profile. One of the biggest issues was that I started working in grade 7.

However, I&#39;ve realized that leaving my retail experience out is leaving out many of the skills I&#39;ve used and built on since then.
