        <p>Andrew Clarkson cohost of Loonie Engineering with Chris Naismith admitted this week that he doesn't listen to podcasts and asked for some recommendations. I'm an avid podcast listener and have had this article on the back burner for ages. So Andrew's LinkedIn post is the carrot to get this article out.</p>
<p>Here's 15 podcasts for devs to enjoy. These are ones that I personally listen to. Five are tech related, five are ones I enjoy when I want to feed my brain but give it a break too, and five are about other cities and countries - including of course Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>Each list is in no particular order, but they are my top five favourite podcasts in each category.</p>
<h2>Five Tech Podcasts to Enjoy</h2>

<h3>1) JS Party</h3>

<h3>5) Design Life</h3>
<p><strong><em>Listen to two women in tech talk about how they balance side projects on top of a full time job. Design Life is a podcast about design and side projects for motivated creators. It was born after your hosts, two serial side project addicts, saw a gap in the podcast market for a conversational show about design and the issues young creatives face, that was hosted by two women.</em></strong></p>
<p>I highly recommend Design Life for devs that want a better understanding of the design process. Both hosts are fellow expat Kiwis (from Aotearoa New Zealand). I ran into Femke on YouTube in 2021 when I was still figuring out my career direction. When I reached out to her she awesomely offered that we have a Google Meet. Only to find out that <strong>Femke and I caught the school bus in Whitby, New Zealand on the opposite sides of the same street.</strong> It's a really small world!</p>

<h3>Bonus: Allied  - An Accessibility Podcast</h3>
<p><strong><em>&quot;A podcast on the people innovating and implementing access across industries.&quot;</em></strong>
I included Allied as a bonus in the tech category as it's only partly digital accessibility. It's an awesome podcast for both A11y and accessibility in general. Allied tells stories, so it's an enjoyable one for listening to on walks.</p>

<h2>Five Podcasts With Engaging Stories and Interesting Facts for Curious Dev Minds</h2>

<h3>1) Stuff the British Stole by Marc Fennell</h3>
<p><strong><em>&quot;Throughout its reign, the British Empire stole a lot of stuff. Today those objects are housed in genteel institutions across the UK and the world. They usually come with polite plaques. This is a series about the not-so-polite history behind those objects.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Each episode, award-winning journalist, author and genetic-potluck, Marc Fennell, picks one artefact and takes you on the wild, evocative, sometimes funny, often tragic adventure of how it got to where it is today.</em></p>
<p><em>These objects will ultimately help us see the Commonwealth ‚Äî and ourselves ‚Äî today, in a different light.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Marc Fennell is one of my favourite podcasters and journalists. The twists and turns in his writing make every episode an engaging puzzle. With Stuff the British Stole, Marc makes difficult topics into wonderful stories that make you think. This is not just a &quot;bad things about colonialism&quot; series, it's also about what is being done to make things right and the people who are doing it.</p>

<h3>Bonus: Nut Jobs by Marc Fennell</h3>
<p><strong><em>&quot;It's the $10 million heist you've never heard of. In a matter of months, dozens of truckloads disappeared from American highways. But what were they carrying? Nuts. Marc Fennell takes you into a rabbit-hole of crime syndicates, stolen identities and private investigators that will change the way you think about food forever. 80% of the world's almonds are grown in the heart of California but this journey will take you to Italy; the Spanish coast; deep under the earth; and even into space.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<li>Gold winner of the Best Documentary Podcast and Best Serialised Podcast Trophies at the 2021 New York Festivals Radio Awards</li>
<li>Winner of the Best Podcast Trophy at the 2020 Mumbrella Publish Awards</li>
<li>Bronze winner of the Best True Crime Podcast at the 2020 Australian Podcast Awards</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a huge fan of Marc Fennell's work. I've listened to this series on Audible twice and it's such a plot twisty often humorous puzzle of investigative journalism. <em>Nut Jobs</em> is only available on Audible so it didn't make the main list.</p>

<h2>Five Podcasts About Other Countries and Cities - Including Aotearoa New Zealand</h2>
<p><img class="img-smaller"
     src="https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9781869620097-us.jpg"
     alt="children's book cover showing a KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç which is a green parrot peaking out of a hole at the base of a tree. The bottom third of the book cover is solid green it reads 'Hoki The Story of a KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç' by Gideon Climo and Alison Balance and"></p>
<p>With remote work and flexible hours devs have the option to travel and/or live in so many different areas around the globe. Here are five podcasts I enjoy about cities and other countries. One of my other passions besides tech, knitting, good stories, and history is urban geography and travel. As a dual Kiwi (Aotearoa New Zealand)/Canadian citizen I've ended up with two from NZ on my top five list.</p>
<h3>1) KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç Files</h3>
<p><strong><em>&quot;Voice of the KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç - an audio adventure through the bumpy bumper 2019 breeding season of NZ's rare flightless parrot. Presented by Alison Ballance.&quot;</em></strong>
Aotearoa New Zealand  is a land of amazing natural beauty. Part of Kiwi culture is &quot;kaitiakitanga&quot; the feeling of responsibility for stewardship and respect for the natural environment. Directly translated from te reo MƒÅori <a href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/kaitiakitanga-guardianship-and-conservation">kaitiakitanga means guardianship and protection</a>. One of the most well known stories is that of the KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç who's scientific name means &quot;owl face - soft feathered&quot;. They're the quirky birds that you can't help fall in love with.</p>
<p>At it's heart Aotearoa New Zealand a land of birds, and if you want to get to know the country and Kiwi culture and/or travel there a great place to start is listening to Radio New Zealand's &quot;KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç Files&quot;. The KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç - very large flightless nocturnal parrots - are an iconic NZ treasure. Critically endangered, with only 248 left, every KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç is named and their journey is followed by New Zealanders in Aotearoa New Zealand and around the world. The one in book above is named <em>&quot;Hoki&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Recommended Episodes:
Though you could listen to the episodes in any order, they're written as a story. Start at the beginning with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/programmes/kakapo-files/story/2018676703/kakap-night-parrot">Episode 01: KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç - night parrot</a> learn about the giant flightless parrot's 'love triangle' - with a tree.</li>
<li>Once you're done the series get an update on the KƒÅkƒÅp√µ with <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/ourchangingworld/audio/2018838677/2022-a-boomer-year-for-kakap">2022 a boomer year for kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç - on the Our Changing World Podcast</a></li>
