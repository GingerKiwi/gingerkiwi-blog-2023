</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            On January 21, 2023 I volunteered at #A11yTOCamp at Microsoft here in Toronto. With the event&#39;s focus on accessibility there were many people with visible mobility aids. This led to many conversations about design and mobility aids. Great design and user experience isn&#39;t just about a product being functional and usable, it should be aesthetically pleasing and bring joy to users. This is true for both digital and physical products. The main inspiration for this article is to have one place to share some of the great designed, beautiful and/or cool mobility aids with others, and to discuss this through the lens of design.

            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            This past November 2022, I did a major refresh of my LinkedIn profile. One of the biggest issues was that I started working in grade 7. So based on my work experience it looked like I&#39;m almost at retirement age! However, I&#39;ve realized that leaving my retail experience out is leaving out many of the skills I&#39;ve used and built on since then.

</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            Welcome to my regular article series  &quot;Bitesize Accessibility&quot; that provides developers with quick and hopefully entertaining information on accessibility! Accessibility doesn&#39;t have to be time consuming, or complex. Learning a little every few weeks, and spending even 5 minutes every hour or two while coding can have huge payoffs.
