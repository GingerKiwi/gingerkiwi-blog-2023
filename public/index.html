        <strong> Welcome to the Ginger Kiwi Blog!</strong> This site is developed with 11ty/Eleventy, Nunjucks, markdown, Obsdian, and css with css variables for colours and fonts - and of course lots of "help" from Boo (my grey cat), as well as Maybel and Kitten. Scroll down to see some of my recent and featured articles, or go the the <a href="https://gingerkiwi.blog/blog/">blog page</a> to see all my  articles.</p>
      <h3>Updates for Fall 2023</h3>
      <p><strong>Nov 13, 2023: Visit <a href="https://gingerkiwi-2024-02.fly.dev rel="noreferrer" rel=”noopener” target=”_blank">https://gingerkiwi-2024-02.fly.dev</a> to see the new combined, fullstack, Ginger Kiwi blog and dev portfolio being built in public on Fly.io using Astro, Docker, and SQLite3!</strong> <br>A static version is also deployed on <a href="https://gingerkiwi.xyz rel="noreferrer" rel=”noopener” target=”_blank">https://gingerkiwi.xyz</a>. <br>My ".xyz" domain is a temporary one I have for testing.</p> 
      <p>It's past time for a redesign of the Ginger Kiwi blog. Having dedicated pages for topics such as French for Devs, design tips for backend devs, DSA, etc, would make the site more user friendly. I also need to set up an RSS, implement some A11y enhancements, fix the styling of article main images, and update the theme to at least a dark mode, and ideally a dark/light toggle. Also, 11ty 2.0 came out months ago, and Astro has been taking off. So I've been on the fence if I'm going to migrate to 11ty 2.0, or try something new with Astro. </p>
      <p>This morning (Tuesday, Nov 07), I saw that Lazar Nikolov has <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-full-stack-blog-with-astro-7ffcf9ec" rel="noreferrer" rel=”noopener” target=”_blank”>a new Astro blog course</a> that's free on Egghead.io for the next two weeks. So here we go! I've started working on a new site that consolodates this blog with my .dev portfolio site.</p>

            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            This is part of my &quot;Monday Motivation Podcasts and Audiobooks for Devs&quot; series on LinkedIn. It&#39;s also an extension of the article &quot;Fifteen Podcasts for Developers to Enjoy&quot; I wrote earlier in 2023. The Country of the Blind by Andrew Leland is both the story of the author gradually becoming blind, and the history and current developments of blind culture and technological innovation. Innovation by blind hackers and makers and the disability community that rose in the 1970s around Berkley University, helped grow Silicon Valley, tech in general, and Artificial Intelligence.

</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            This is the first in a series of articles on tips and tricks for web and app design - both for backend dev, and new developers. Every time I get in a discussion with backend or sometimes full-stack devs that prefer the backend, they say that one reason they prefer backend is that they&#39;re &quot;not good at design&quot;. However, with a few simple tools and tips even those scared of design can become more comfortable in designing good looking apps. Today we&#39;re looking at where to find Figma design files and then how to quickly use them to get started coding.

For the past couple of weeks I&#39;ve been focusing on improving my css and design skills by doing Gary Simon&#39;s UI Design course on Scrimba.com. Today, I finished building a simple layout that started with just one level 1 heading and a single sentance paragraph.

            Over the weekend I expanded my Yarn Help! website https://yarnhelp.app to include calculations for the number of balls of yarn needed for scarfs, cat mats, and baby blankets. I also added a [Doctor Who Scarf page](https://yarnhelp.app/doctorwho.html).

</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            Andrew Clarkson, cohost of Loonie Engineering with Chris Naismith, admitted this week that he doesn&#39;t listen to podcasts and asked for some recommendations. I&#39;m an avid podcast listener and have had this article on the back burner for ages. So Andrew&#39;s LinkedIn post is the carrot to get this article out. Here&#39;s 15 podcasts for devs to enjoy. Five are tech related, five podcasts with engaging stories and interesting facts for curious dev minds, and five are about other cities and countries - including of course Aotearoa New Zealand.

</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            I had a couple of quite negative experiences last night. One I have to continue to deal with sometime today. However, I want to start the day on a positive note with sharing a story about the amazing person who was my first retail manager, Namroo. As I was only 13 years old, I was expecting to just be sweeping and mopping floors and cleaning up at the corner shop. Instead, this amazing man with over 40 years of retail management experience treated me like an apprentice. I got trained on every single last part of grocery retail. He&#39;s had a life-long impact on me.

</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            International Wheelchair Day is an annual global event that started in 2008 to celebrate the positive impacts that wheelchairs have had on wheelchair users&#39; lives. For fellow developers, and engineers this may not be a coding article, but it&#39;s still relevant for us. Disabled people are our coworkers and peers as well as users of our apps, websites, and software. Also, wheelchairs are a huge awesome technical feat of engineering and design. Did you know that electric wheelchairs and power assist add ons for active user manual wheelchairs often have connected software and apps? Plus, I included a free dev resource at the end of the article!

</h2>
            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            On January 21, 2023 I volunteered at #A11yTOCamp at Microsoft here in Toronto. With the event&#39;s focus on accessibility there were many people with visible mobility aids. This led to many conversations about design and mobility aids. Great design and user experience isn&#39;t just about a product being functional and usable, it should be aesthetically pleasing and bring joy to users. This is true for both digital and physical products. The main inspiration for this article is to have one place to share some of the great designed, beautiful and/or cool mobility aids with others, and to discuss this through the lens of design.

            <p class="article-body article-recent-p">
            This past November 2022, I did a major refresh of my LinkedIn profile. One of the biggest issues was that I started working in grade 7. So based on my work experience it looked like I&#39;m almost at retirement age! However, I&#39;ve realized that leaving my retail experience out is leaving out many of the skills I&#39;ve used and built on since then.
